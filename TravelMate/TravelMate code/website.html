                    Cebu is the hub around which the Visayas revolve. It is the most densely populated island in the Philippines and is
                     second only to Luzon in its strategic and economic importance to the country. This is one of the most prosperous regions 
                     in the country – the 2016 growth rate was 8.8%, considerably higher than the national average. Tourism numbers are booming, 
                     Cebu draws almost two million foreign travellers a year. The island's prime attractions are its white-sand beaches and spectacular
                      diving, chiefly off the northern tip of Cebu at Malapascua and down on the southwest coast at Moalboal. And don't ignore 
                      much-maligned Cebu City, which has lively bars, emerging eateries and burgeoning retail appeal.

                    Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is one of the most ancient cities in the world. This place offers examples of both contemporary
                     and classical architecture right in the city center. A renowned destination for typical cuisine, home to fascinating attractions
                      and hospitable people, and a diverse region with a combination of multi-communities. There is plenty to enjoy in Hanoi, from
                       mouthwatering street food to fascinating history, from traditional entertainment to recreational activities. Even with a short
                        amount of time, you can still feel the tranquilness of the city while sipping a cup of coffee. Wandering around and shooting 
                        artistic photos on elegant streets in the Old Quarter would give you unique experiences that are hardly found anywhere else. 
                        Outside the suburban areas, you can discover small charming villages which are homes to so many ethnic minorities.

                    Sapa town stands at the head of a deep valley of magnificent rice terraces that are still farmed today as they have been for 
                    centuries. Backdrops don’t get much more spectacular. Enticing ribbons of road lead the eye down to the valley floor, white-water
                     rivers rush among rice fields, and lush green mountains stretch into the distance as far as the eye can see. The highest peak in
                      the region, Mount Fansipan, crowns the ragged ridge line high above town.
